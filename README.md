# Hierarchical-Finite-State-Machine
A 3D implementation of Mina PÃªcheux's tutorial.

There are probably improvements to be made, especially in the UpdatePhysics() function of the Jumping.cs script.

The player is a capsule, with a Rigidbody whose rotation constraints have been frozen, and the PlayerStateMachine script.

The ground is a plane, with the layer set to Ground (layer 6).
